        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A family trifle story. One night Mom was serving trifle for dessert and Dad declined saying he didn't care for it. "But you like everything in it: cake, custard, jam. You're just being fussy" Mom said. <p>
        <p>Dad objected to that label and a discussion ensued about what fussy means. To end the dispute I located our dictionary and looked up the definition of "fussy". We were all amused to find fussy defined as "one who worries over trifles".</p>
